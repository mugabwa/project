“Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster film making, the result of years of
 work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie
 with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It’s really like nothing that
 Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series,
 but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most:
 It’s hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off
 a few ones that fans won’t expect to be on the list. It’s a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history
 that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it’s on the higher end of the
 MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few
 legitimate thrills along the way. Don’t worry: I will stay very spoiler-free. The main joy of this film is
 in how its incredibly complex narrative unfolds, and you can go elsewhere if you want that ruined.
 The disappointing “Avengers: Infinity War” ended with Thanos finally getting all of the six Infinity Stones he
 so desperately sought, and then using them to wipe out half of existence, including beloved heroes like Black
 Panther, Star-Lord, and Spider-Man.

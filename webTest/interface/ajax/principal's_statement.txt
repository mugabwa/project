I am certainly delighted to be in Nairobi School. Thank you so much for your home reception.
It is definitely exciting working with young boys and helping them realize their potential.
Young people have deep well of incredible potential. Teaching is therefore a relational occupation.
We establish relations with these young boys as they go through life. Let us stay awake and make a difference in life.
Let us aspire to be great. Lets us identify our uttermost purposes. Finally remember that hope is essential in life so
let us maintain and develop our hopes for what matters most in life is not how we begin but rather how we finish.
